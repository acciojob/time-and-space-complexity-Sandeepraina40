	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. A common example is O(n), where memory usage grows linearly with input size.</p>
